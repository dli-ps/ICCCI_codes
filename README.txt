An Adaptive Blind Video Watermarking Technique based on SD-BPSO and DWT-SVD

Data Exchange in the form of multimedia has seen a tremendous increase in the past decade thereby requiring a need for better security and protection for proprietary rights. Blind Watermarking is a well-established authentication technique and in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for watermarking videos. The proposed concepts include Adaptive Frame Selection using SD-BPSO to ensure the watermarks have least detrimental effects on the video as a whole. The integrity of the video is validated using the Peak Signal to Nose Ratio (PSNR). The robustness of the algorithm is also tested by subjecting the videos to several standard attacks such as -- rotation, cropping, image shift, histogram equalization and image sharpening. Bit Error Rate (BER) is also used, in order to determine the efficiency of the system in retaining the watermark.

Current repository contains Matlab codes which were used to determine the results in the paper.
